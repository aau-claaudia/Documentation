# User documentation - Strato Compute Cloud

Hello and welcome to the documentation for Strato, a cloud computing service offered by CLAAUDIA.

## Important rules that you should be aware of:
* You may not use Strato for data categories 2 and 3. See the [AAU data classification guide]()
* There will **NOT** be made backup of the data you upload to the cloud, so do not delete your own copy. The data is safe in the cloud, as the storage system replicates it. There is just no additional backup, so if you by accident delete it from the cloud, it will be gone, and needs to be re-uploaded.
* You will have **full ownership** of the instance you create and can therefore install additional software, tweak it, or use it as is.


## What is Strato
Strato is a compute cloud hosted at AAU. Strato is based on OpenStack, which allows a user to create and manage a virtual machine. The user can launch multiple instances based on different flavors and images. The flavour is the computing resource and the image is the initial operating system plus software.
