# User documentation - Strato Compute Cloud

Hello and welcome to the documentation for Strato, a cloud computing service offered by CLAAUDIA.

## Important rules that you should be aware of:
* You may not use Strato for data categories 2 and 3. See the [AAU data classification guide](https://www.security.aau.dk/dataclassification/model/)
* There will **NOT** be made backup of the data you upload to the cloud, so do not delete your own copy. The data is safe in the cloud, as the storage system replicates it. There is just no additional backup, so if you by accident delete it from the cloud, it will be gone, and needs to be re-uploaded.
* You will have **full ownership** of the instance you create, allowing you to install additional software, customize it, or use it as is.
* You are responsible for maintaining and updating all systems and tools to ensure their security and protection against malware.

## What is Strato
Strato is a compute cloud hosted at AAU. Strato is based on OpenStack, which allows a user to create and manage a virtual machine. The user can launch multiple instances based on different flavors and images. The flavour is the computing resource and the image is the initial operating system plus software.

## What is it good for?
- Research. Especially data driven research with large computational needs.
- Minor services that need to run for long periods of time.
- To relocate your data processing activities to a cloud based, but personal server.
- A safe place to try cloud computing and running your own server.
- Scale the computing up and down depending on your needs.
- Running GPU heavy services for short periods of time.

## What is it not good for?
- Production systems that require 24/7 uptime.
- Anything with sensitive data storage or processing requirements.
- Email servers or large scale communications.
- Anying shady, nefarious, questionable, below board or illegal
