# Application guides

All Strato instances are essentially Linux computers with [headless interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer), and they can run virtually any Linux application that exists. This will be a new experience for many users who are not familiar with operation a computer from the command line, and they may wish to install graphical user interfaces, to get a more familiar desktop computer experience. This is possible, but not necessarily a good idea (read our section on [Graphical User Interfaces]("link")).

We therefore encourage our users to learn just a few of the basic Linux commands. [Linux journey](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell) has a good and concise overview of the most important ones. If you work with computing or data analysis by any stretch, this skill will likely be useful for you in the future.

Users should also know that a great number of applications can be accessed instantly via [DeiC Interactive HPC](https://cloud.sdu.dk/). They require no installation and rely much more on GUI interactions.

Further many users could also benefit from reading about our other computing services at [our website](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/research-data/high-performance-computing).
