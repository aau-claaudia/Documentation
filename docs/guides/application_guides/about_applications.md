# About applications on Strato

All Strato instances are essentially Linux computers with [headless interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer), and they can run virtually any Linux application that exists. This will be a new experience for many users who are not familiar with operating a computer from the command line, and they may wish to install graphical user interfaces, to get a more familiar desktop computer experience. This is possible, but not necessarily a good idea (read our section on [Graphical User Interfaces](https://www.strato-docs.claaudia.aau.dk/guides/application_guides/gui.md)).

We therefore encourage our users to learn a few of the basic Linux commands - an good and concise overview of the most imporant ones can be found at [linuxjourney.com](https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell). If you work with computing or data analysis by any stretch, this skill will likely be useful for you in the future.

Users should also know that a great number of applications can be accessed instantly via [DeiC Interactive HPC](https://cloud.sdu.dk/). They require no installation and rely much more on GUI interactions.

Further many users could also benefit from reading about our other computing services at [our website](https://www.researcher.aau.dk/guides/research-data/high-performance-computing).
