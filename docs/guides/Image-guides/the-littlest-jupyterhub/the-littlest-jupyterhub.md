# Installing the littlest jupyterhub

1. Make sure you have python3, python3-dev, curl and git installed.```
sudo apt install python3 python3-dev git curl ```

2. Copy the text below, and paste it into the terminal. Replace <admin-user-name> with the name of the first admin user for this JupyterHub. Choose any name you like (donâ€™t forget to remove the brackets!). This admin user can log in after the JupyterHub is set up, and can configure it to their needs. Remember to add your username! ``` curl -L https://tljh.jupyter.org/bootstrap.py | sudo -E python3 - --admin <admin-user-name> ```
3. Press Enter to start the installation process. This will take 5-10 minutes, and will say Done! when the installation process is complete
4. Copy the Public IP or campus IP of your server, and try accessing http://<public-ip/campus-ip> from your browser. If everything went well, this should give you a JupyterHub login page.
5. Login using the admin user name you used in step 3. You can choose any password that you wish. Use a strong password & note it down somewhere, since this will be the password for the admin user account from now on.![login](../../../assets/img/tlhj/first-login.png)
