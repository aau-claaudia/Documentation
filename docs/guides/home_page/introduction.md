# Introduction

Strato is an on-premise cloud platform based on servers with CPU and GPU components that enable you to solve both generic and specific computational problems using virtual machines that you can configure yourself. This can be for both short-term problem solving, as well as work that takes a long time.

Strato is a Linux-based virtual computer platform to support data driven research that needs additional processing capacity. Network storage allows users to store and process large datasets, and the OpenStack platform allows the user to change the size of the computer (processing capacity) that is connected to their boot disk.

The Strato platform is a cluster of hardware that is virtualised to create instances that essentially function as a regular computer environment. Strato Instances are virtual machines, that can be launched by the user when they need it. When the instance has been created, it can be accessed from a terminal application on the user's local computer. The required software can then be installed and configured to the user's needs. By using Strato your research can benefit from additional RAM, CPU and GPU hardware. Strato can thus provide you with flexibility and additional computational power, when your research needs it.

## Required skills and knowledge

Operating Strato involves running your own Linux virtual machine and learning how to use the Linux terminal environment. It can also be useful to understand secure connections through SSH and secure file transfer protocols.
