# Resizing an instance

Maybe you have created an instance and after a bit of time realized that you need a larger instance, or that you can resize to a smaller. In this case it is possible to resize if there are sufficient resources in the cloud to do so.

To resize, do the following:

1. Go to your instance - Compute->Instances.
2. Rightmost under columns "Actions" roll-down and select "Resize Instance".
3. Select the new instance size. Notice that CPU and RAM goes together so an increased amount of RAM would also implies more CPU and vice versa.
4. Click "Resize".
5. If it is possible to resize (enough resources if you ask for a larger flavor), the system should prepare the resize.
6. After a bit of time then you will need to finally hit "Confirm" again in the rightmost "Action" column for your instance.

You have now resized your image.
