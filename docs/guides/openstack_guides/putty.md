# Connect to instance from Windows (using PuTTY) 
Some versions of Windows do not support OpenSSH out of the box. This means that you can't use the SSH-key generated by the Openstack-platform (in the format *.pem*). We recommend a solution where you use [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) to convert your SSH-key to a PuTTY supported format and then connect to your instance. 

## Convert SSH-key
To convert your *.pem-key you must do the following:

* Open "PuTTYgen" (e.g., from the Start menu, click All Programs > PuTTY > PuTTYgen).
* Click "Load"  (as shown in the image below):

* Browse to the location of the private key file that you want to convert (e.g., *MyPersonalKey.pem*).  
  Note: By default, PuTTYgen displays only files with extension *.ppk*. Make sure to enable show all files, so you can see your *.pem*-file (as shown in the image). Also the private key file must end with a newline character or PuTTYgen cannot load it correctly.

* Select your *.pem* key file and click Open.
* If everything went well PuTTYgen displays the following message:  
  ![Alt Description](../../assets/img/openstack/puttygennotice.png?raw=true "Title")
* When you click OK, PuTTYgen displays a dialog box with information about the key you loaded, such as the public key and the fingerprint.
* Optional: Enter and confirm a key passphrase (If you use a passphrase you will have to enter this passphrase whenever you authenticate with your key.)
* Click Save private key to save the key in PuTTY's format.

* Save your *MyPersonalKey.ppk* file somewhere secure.


## Connect to instance
Now that you have converted your SSH-key from the *.pem*-format to the *.ppk*-format, we can use PuTTY to connect to our instance.

1. Open PuTTY. 
2. In the tree on the left find:  Connection > SSH > Auth > Credentials
3. Click on the ‘Browse...’ button under Private key file for authentication:  
   ![Alt Description](../../assets/img/openstack/putty_key_auth.png?raw=true "Title")
4. Select the *.ppk*-file (your private key) you just saved.
5. Go in the tree on the left to ‘Session’
6. Enter in the ‘Host Name (or IP address)’ field the username and floating IP address of the instance:  
   ![Alt Description](../../assets/img/openstack/putty_ubuntu.png?raw=true "Title")
7. Optional: Enter a name for the session in the ‘Saved Sessions’ field and click save. This saves all the settings, including the private key for this session.
8. Click Open to connect to the instance.
9. When you connect for the first time you’ll be asked if you trust this computer. Normally you can click 'Yes'.

10. If you’re connecting to an instance with a floating IP that you used before you’ll get this warning message. If that’s the case, it’s safe to click Yes as well.

11. If everything works alright you’re now logged in.

## Additional information

* The *.ppk*-formatted SSH-key can also be given to programs like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php), which can be used to transfer files to and from your instance.  
* If you want to use GUIs using X11 forwarding, you can follow the guide [here](https://superuser.com/questions/119792/how-to-use-x11-forwarding-with-putty).
